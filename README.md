## About Me
Hello, my name is Chung En Liu. I graduated from the Department of Computer Science at National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, where I built a strong foundation in computer systems and software development.  

I have hands-on experience in network and system administration, with a particular focus on UNIX-based environments. My technical background also includes programming in C, C++, and Python, which I have applied to both academic and personal projects.  

Currently, I am expanding my expertise in machine learning and artificial intelligence applications. I am passionate about leveraging these technologies to solve real-world problems and continuously improving my skills in this rapidly evolving field.
